You are working in repository `sampleproject-first-cycle-retest`.

Before mutating anything:
1. Inspect the repository root and current branch.
2. Read `.agentic/config.yaml`.
3. Treat `.agentic/transfer/inbox/` as the workspace transfer inbox carrier.

Default branch: `main`
Project type: `python`

Private/public boundary: no secrets, credentials, private chat fragments, or
personal logs belong in any versioned part of `.agentic/`. Machine-local state
lives under `.agentic/tmp/`; local rule acknowledgement state lives under
`.agentic/rule_ack/`. Both are ignored by construction.
